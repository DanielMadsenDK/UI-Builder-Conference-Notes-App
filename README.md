# Welcome!
Hola! @MGOPW here. The [Build Along Month project](https://sn.works/BuildAlongMonth) was a challenge that took place in August 2024 on the [You & I Builder Live](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3rNcyAiDYK2Bgzj4mRdtfxMpGkI5KXBJ) show. The goal was to provide a starting point to custom application development in ServiceNow with a focus on building a custom workspace through UI Builder. And this repository is the next step in the journey! 

Your mission, should you choose to accept it, will be to create your own variant of the project's landing page and innovate! Follow the stories in the [Build Along Month home page](https://sn.works/BuildAlongMonth), check out the resources and videos, and showcase your talents. Go above and beyond and create a one of a kind application experience to wow everyone! If we get enough submitted variants, we'll even feature the best on the livestream and show off your work. 

This repository is part of a larger coordinated effort by the ServiceNow Developer Advocate to provide lots of fun ServiceNow projects for Hacktoberfest. Be sure to check out the [main repository README](https://github.com/ServiceNowDevProgram/Hacktoberfest) to see what else you can participate in!
