# Contributing

## General requirements

- Pull request descriptions must be explicit and descriptive to what is being changed.
  - Changes that are not within the scope of the description will result in the entire PR being rejected
- Low effort/spam Pull Requests will be marked as spam accordingly.


## Process

When you fork the repository and add it to your instance, you'll be greeted by the `U&I Conference notes` workspace with a default landing page. Here's what you need to do to participate:
1. Create a variant of the Home page, name it after your github user name. DO NOT include any personal information in the variants or data you might add to the app. 
2. Read the instructions and follow the stories on the [Build Along Month project](https://sn.works/BuildAlongMonth) page.
3. Go beyond the stories and make something super awesome!

Avoid editing other people's variants, as this could create collissions and cause your pull request to be rejected. You can submit multiple pull requests to update your own variant as you iterate through your work, you aren't limited to just one submission. 

**Note: if you encounter an error stating "Private application scope" when you go to build the pages in UI Builder, you should give yourself the `x_snc_bam_you_i_0.user` and `x_snc_bam_you_i_0.admin` roles.**
